# HashCrack-AI 

## Purpose:
Hashcrack-AI is an automated python script that is designed to use GPU instances provided by https://vast.ai, to deploy a Dockerized Hashcat CUDA instance https://github.com/dizcza/docker-hashcat. Once the instance is deployed the script will upload the hash file, download the specified wordlist or it will download a wordlist onto the instance and will attempt to crack the hash.

This tool eliminates the complexity of manually configuring and launching GPU-powered environments for password cracking, enabling ethical hackers and penetration testers to focus on their engagements.

# Why Use Hashcrack-AI?

- Cost-Effective GPU Access: Vast.ai offers powerful GPU instances at competitive rates. Hashcrack-AI simplifies access to these resources, ensuring you can crack hashes without investing in expensive hardware.
- Time-Saving Automation: With this python script, you can deploy a pre-configured Hashcat instance tailored for high-performance password cracking, saving time on setup and configurations.
- Scalable Performance: Choose from a range of GPU options based on your project needs, scaling your computing power as necessary for large or complex hash cracking tasks.

# How does it work?

At the time of development, this script will work on Linux systems. This script has not been tested on any Windows Operating Systems.

1. Generates an SSH key (hashcrack, hashcrack.pub) and loads the SSH Key into your Vast AI account.
2. Uses Vast.ai to find an avaliable instance with the pre-selected GPU and the number of GPU devices.
3. Builds the instance using the Hashcat Cuda Docker Container https://github.com/dizcza/docker-hashcat
4. Installs the necessary packages needed to download the wordlists
5. Download's the custom wordlist or pre-set wordlist
6. Upload the file that contains the hash you want to attempt to crack
7. Create's a tmux session to run Hashcat to crack the hash.
8. If a cracked.txt file appears, the script will print the output of the hash with the cracked password.
9. If cracked.txt does not appear then the hash could not be cracked or an error could have occured.
10. Before destroying the instance, you can ssh into using the generated ssh key.
11. When you are done with the instance you can press "ENTER" and the script will terminate the instance when you are done with it.

# Package Requirements

```
pipx install vastai
```

# Setup Requirements: 

1. Create an account on https://vast.ai.
2. In the Billing section select "Add Credit" to add the amount of credit you want to utilize.
3. Under "Account" copy your API Key. The format of your key should look something like this: "2f51bcc1cb5ac169c9a4785b21d10d0ef4f4508a8924b5030b22253ca8ec0384"
4. Using the vastcli add your api-key into the program

```
$ vastai --api-key "2f51bcc1cb5ac169c9a4785b21d10d0ef4f4508a8924b5030b22253ca8ec0384"
```

5. You are ready to start cracking with Vast.ai!

# Need more firepower?

As of now, the script is set to search for instances that have six GPU's running RTX 4090's. This can be modified in the script depending on the GPU you want and the number of GPU's you want in your instance: 

```
    print(Fore.GREEN + "Searching for an appropriate instance...")
    search_command = (
        "vastai search offers 'datacenter = True disk_space > 50 inet_down>1000 gpu_name = RTX_4090 num_gpus > 6' "
        "| awk 'NR > 1 {print $0 | \"sort -k10,10n\"}' | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }'"
    )
    instance_id = run_command(search_command, capture_output=True)
```
